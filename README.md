## What is this project about?

Creating an "auto-chess" style fighting game using a new coding language.

## Who is the project for?

This project is targeted towards people who have an interest in unique auto chess games or games built in Lua.

# Design

## Reason

Auto-chess games exist in a wide variety of shapes and sizes all with varying levels of popularity. The most painful part about playing any of these games is balance, additions, and the game as a whole is run by an external source. By creating our own auto-chess game we can get the same entertaining experience but any changes can be made as we see fit.

### In depth Feature Explanation

**1. Multiplayer**

The goal with multiplayer is to have a player "create" a game and to use their computer/device as the host. When a game is created a code will be generated that the other player can input to connect to their server. Codes will be randomly generated and unique. 

**5. Shop**

The shop will host five pets and two items. All items and pets will be in a list with values attached to them correlating to their rarity. Items and pets will be randomly selected with chances, albeit small, for any rarity of pet allowed at the time. Certain tiers of pets will be unlocked as the game progresses but not available until a certain point to ensure that one side doesn't win purely off of luck. Items will work based on the same system. A stack will be generated at the end of combat which will hold all of the items and pets to be added into the shop as well as other potential shop rotations. The other rotations will be used if the player decides to spend their money on a new rotation.

**5.5. Shop Pity**

In order for games to not be based entirely off of luck and make it so that more often than not the better skilled player will win a pity system will be added to the shop. The pity system will act as a multiplier for the player's odds of getting rare pets and items. The size of the multiplier will increase in small amounts every time a shop is rolled without a rare pet, a large amount on wins, and a small amount on losses. Pity resets when a rare pet or item is attained to ensure the winning player doesn't continue to get lots of high quality pets in a row. Level Ups will increase the base multiplier of the pity making it easier to stack up large amounts.

**6. Combat**

Combat will not be turn based as the "auto-chess" genre of game focuses on having the pets fight as they are after the player has arranged them with minimal to no outside impact from the player after combat starts. Combat begins with the both of the first pets placed in line to preform their actions at the same time. This will then continue until a pet dies and then moves onto the next pet in line until all of a players pets are defeated. Combat can be sped up to reduce time wasted if the both players agree on it. A prompt will be put on the opposite player's screen if one side clicks the speed up button. Combat will have the pets attack at the same time in a lineup.

**7. Statistics**

Relevant stats will be saved at the end of the game such as gold earned, pets bought, items bought, time spent, round won, rounds lost, rare pets bought, rare pets earned, average combat win percentage, average combat loss percentage etc... The stats will be saved to a document that can be opened by the player and a "stats" tab will be added later for ingame viewing.

**8. Items**

The two main types of items in the game will be cosmetic and buff based. Cosmetic items can be purchased with money earned from winning complete matches and will provide no in game benefit. buff based items will be used during gameplay to enhance your pets by giving them stat boosts or unique effects based on which item you have. The explanation of which items you can buy and how to buy them is explained in the shop section. The goal with items is to have a massive variety to choose from so the items don't become boring quickly and the potential for team compositions and item builds is large.

**9. Fighters** 

Similar to items the goal for the fighters/pets is to have a massive variety so that there is as many team compositions as possible. Fighters will be divided based on their class and rarity. The classes will include support, damage, tank, assassin, and flex. The difference between classes will be mostly based on intrinsic traits and stat distribution. Support classes will have low damage and low health making them easy to kill while having intrinsic traits focused on increasing the damage of those in front of or to the side of them. Damage classes will have moderate health with a large amount of damage and intrinsic traits focused on dealing more damage or buffing themselves based on damage dealt. Tanks will have low damage but high health acting as a polar opposite to damage dealers. Assassins will have low health and moderate damage but intrinsic traits focused on high value targets or sneak attacks such as attacking supports at the back of the line or attacking when it isn't their turn. Flex class will have moderate health and moderate damage and be a jack of all trades, master of none, style character.

**10. Level Ups**

Level Ups will bring a unique tactical advantage for players to focus on or avoid. Experience can be earned by paying for it or winning matches, losing matches will give a very small amount as well. After reaching a threshold, higher levels having higher thresholds, the player will level up. The higher the player's level is the more gold they will earn for a win while also taking less damage from a loss. It will also increase the odds the player has of finding rare pets and items and at certain milestones (3, 6, 9...) the player will unlock rarities of pets and items previously locked behind level requirements. At major milestones (5, 10, 15...) the player will earn the ability to play more pets than the base amount, one per major milestone. The goal with leveling up is to entice players with a wide variety of benefits in the long run but no immediate return adding more strategy to the game.

## Pet List
